#### Bio
I’m Katerina and a long time I work as IT recruiter. It’s very interesting but became a time the changes.
I decided to go to opposite side of computer monitor and start to do cool things.
I do motivated to become a skilled JS developer.
I like this language because I’m visual person and like to see the results what I did just now.
#### Some code sample:
```javascript
function squareDigits(num){
    return Number( String(num).split(‘’).map(x=>String(( Number(x)**2))).join(‘’))
}
```
